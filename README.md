# Django/React/Channels App

A full-stack pet project based on https://testdriven.io/courses/taxi-react

We're using Django for the administion interface, Django Rest Framework to provide data to a React 16 front-end, and using Channel/Websockets for real-time communication.

End-to-end testing is being implemented using Cypress.
